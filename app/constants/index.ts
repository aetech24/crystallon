As a consultant, I provide a range of high-quality advisory and support services to help individuals / companies successfully establish business operations in foreign markets. I have extensive experience with creating aggressive financing strategies for projects of any scale, on a global level. I partner with my clients to create and implement high-impact business development solutions that will drive business growth. My goal is to ensure that all business development efforts are focused on activities that result in a significant return on investment. In addition, I assist my clients in securing financing through strategic alliances, securities and institutional investments. My strength and expertise is in finding and leveraging unique financial instruments, as well as developing strategies and innovative pedagogy that are hitherto unexplored to effectuate huge projects that cannot be accomplished through conventional means . Because this process includes tremendous levels of preliminary development of business plan models and action plans to determine feasibility, people look to me to have the knowledge of alternative financing products that banks cannot offer, due to their own limitations. I work with my clients to assess their needs and present the right solutions to help them reach their goals. My overall goal for all Clients is to establish Action Plans through the formulation of a clear set of measurable objectives which will focus on the specific needs of targeted services to be provided to each individual Client.",

      "I am spiritual, Life Coach Prophetess with over nine plus years in Outreach Ministry. I am very accomplished in getting community members strengthen their relationship with God. I specialize in Introspective Psychology; in that I help others understand that their life is a transformative canvas; an otherwise hidden meaning made to defy with free will and destiny, as living revolutionary clay. It has the occult ability to add value to itself or at the very least lay golden eggs. But, at the end of the day, whosoever subscribes to it can be certain to have lived in the fullness of self, touched the depths of truth and felt the hem of heaven. It is a canvas which allows one to explore all aspects of life; the good and bad, personal and impersonal, meaningful and confusing. It's all relevant. Every perspective and experience reflects a piece of a much larger puzzle. These pieces need to fit together to reveal the complete picture. As individuals, we are all integral parts of life - our lives means something and our respective canvases are the platforms for us to grow in understanding, to experience and discover our own evolutionary path. However, this journey starts by putting all the pieces on the table and embracing all that is us, in efforts to operate in the fullness of that self. Contrary to popular believe, it isn't circumscribed to the five senses. It cannot be seen, felt, smelled, tasted or heard. As such, it is never limited and never complete. It is an immense sensibility akin to a huge spider web of the finest silken threads, suspended in the chamber of an individual’s consciousness and catching every airborne particle in its tissue. However, it is the kind of thing one experiences only when operating in complete fullness of self.",
